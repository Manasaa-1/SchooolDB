# School DB

The **School DB** project is a web-based application developed using Spring Framework, implementing a layered architecture for managing school-related data. The system allows users to perform CRUD operations on school records, such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting school information. The project follows Springâ€™s multi-layered design, ensuring clear separation of concerns.

## Features

- **Add New School**: Allows the addition of new schools with details like name, address, contact information, and other related data.
- **View Schools**: Displays a list of all the schools stored in the database, with details such as school name, address, and more.
- **Update School Details**: Modify the existing school data to keep the records up-to-date.
- **Delete School Records**: Remove schools from the database as needed.
- **Search and Filter**: Provides the ability to search and filter school records based on specific criteria (e.g., location, size, etc.).

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Controller Layer (Presentation Layer)
- This layer manages HTTP requests and responses.
- The `Controller` handles the user input from the front-end and routes it to the service layer for processing.
- It uses Spring annotations like `@Controller` and `@RequestMapping` for routing requests to the right endpoints.

### 2. Service Layer (Business Logic Layer)
- Contains the business logic of the application.
- This layer processes requests from the controller layer and interacts with the repository to perform CRUD operations on the database.
- It is responsible for implementing business rules and applying validation before sending or receiving data to/from the repository.

### 3. Repository Layer (Data Access Layer)
- This layer communicates directly with the database using Hibernate or JPA.
- It provides methods to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the `School` entity.
- Defined using the `@Repository` annotation, it abstracts the database interaction.

### 4. Entity Layer
- The entity layer contains the `School` class, which represents the `School` table in the database.
- The class defines various attributes such as `schoolID`, `schoolName`, `schoolAddress`, and more, which map to the corresponding columns in the database.
- This layer is mapped using JPA annotations.

## What the Project Does

- **School Management**: Provides a simple, user-friendly interface to manage school data, allowing administrators to add, view, update, and delete school details in the database.
- **Centralized Database**: Stores all school information in a MySQL database, ensuring centralized access to school records.
- **Search and Filter**: Enables users to search for schools based on specific criteria, such as location, or school type.
- **RESTful Services**: The project is designed as a RESTful web service, which can be easily extended to integrate with front-end applications or other systems.

## How It Works

1. Users interact with the front-end to manage school information.
2. The `Controller Layer` receives requests and passes them to the `Service Layer`.
3. The `Service Layer` processes the requests, applying any necessary business logic.
4. The `Repository Layer` interacts with the database to execute the necessary CRUD operations.
5. Results are returned to the user in the form of a web page or JSON response.

## Future Enhancements

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Integrate user roles and permissions (e.g., Admin, Teacher) using Spring Security.
- **Pagination and Sorting**: Implement pagination and sorting mechanisms for large datasets.
- **Reporting**: Add reporting capabilities to generate school performance reports.
- **Front-end Integration**: Extend the application with front-end frameworks like Angular or React for a better user interface.
